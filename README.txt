To set everything up, go into config.json and change a couple variables:

Replace "YOURSITEHERE" with the link to your nightscout site. It should look something like this: "yournightscout.herokuapp.com".

If you want to publicly display the link to your nightscout site, set displayNightscoutSite to true. (False by default)

If you want to change the low/high alert values from the default, feel free.

Finally, if you use mmol/L change units to "mmol". (Note: the alarm values will still be in mg/dl.)
